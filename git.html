<!-- ! git log -->
<!-- ! git log --oneline -->
<!-- * git branch -m main    *changes branch name (from master perhaps) to main -->
<!-- ! git branch <branch name> -->
<!-- ! git checkout <branch name> -->
<!-- ! git checkout -b <branch name>    *shorthand to create a branch and checkout into it -->

<!-- ! git config --global init.defaultBranch main (this will make future master branches named main instead - if this works) -->
<!-- ! git branch -m <branch name>    (to change a branch name) -->
<!-- ! git branch -M <branch name>    (to change a branch name - but with the capital -M if this branch name already exists it may overwrite the branch!!!) -->

<!-- ! git branch -d <branch_name>    *deletes a branch if you're not on the one you're deleting -->

<!-- ? Pushing to GitHub -->
<!-- ! git remote add origin https://github.com/Jaxeus/git-2.0.git (used to manage remote repository - for backup purposes, usually) -->

<!-- ! git remote -v    (to check the version of our remote origin) -->

<!-- * git fetch (automatically called when we git pull) -->

<!-- ! git branch -m main (may need to do this before pushing to GitHub) -->

<!-- ! git push -u <remote> <branch>    (-u is --set-upstream, this sets and pushes to the remote branch you specify) -->
<!-- ! If you do    git push --set-upstream origin main   then it will push your local main to the main on GitHub. If you are on a different branch you may need to do it again for a new branch matching the same name -->

<!-- ? Other flags -->
<!-- * git branch -r  (lists all branches at origin - maybe ones you haven't created) -->
<!-- * git branch -a  (to see all local and remote branches) -->

<!-- ? Checking a commit's code on the CLI -->
<!-- ! git checkout <commit ID>    (this will switch you to a commit - viewing a commit, you're in a 'detached HEAD' state - like a read-only area unless you commit something. You're kind of in an out of body (tree) viewing. You can use this to check what your code was at the commit you specify the ID for!) -->
<!-- ! git switch -   (to exit your transcendental experience viewing a previous commit) -->

<!-- ? Day 28 - Git Merge -->

<!-- * git reflog (shows a comprehensive log of your actions taken, including commits, deletions, rebases etc.) -->

<!-- ! git revert <commit ID>    (undoes a commit - you often use it straight after your most recent commit but you can do it with other commits - it will bring out another file in your VSCode/editor and then you can change the revert commit message. Once you close that file it will revert.) -->

<!-- ? Merging -->
<!-- ! git checkout main/<branch you want to merge other branch INTO> -->
<!-- ! git merge <branch you want to merge INTO branch above -->
<!-- ! git push (to push to GitHub) -->
<!-- * If you have uncommitted files, it won't let you switch to another branch. Add/commit first. You will also need to push from main to see the changes in main in your GitHub and push from other branches to see their updates on GitHub too -->

<!-- ? Pull requests -->
<!-- * On GitHub, not VS Code. Used to notify team members that they have completed a feature/page and give others an opportunity to review one's code before accepting the merge - the pull request is like forum discussing the proposed feature pending a merge -->

<!-- ! Let's do a pull request -->
<!-- Here are some changes -->
<!-- add, commit, push, then go on GitHub and create a pull request -->
