<!-- ! git log -->
<!-- ! git log --oneline -->
<!-- * git branch -m main    *changes branch name (from master perhaps) to main -->
<!-- ! git branch <branch name> -->
<!-- ! git checkout <branch name> -->
<!-- ! git checkout -b <branch name>    *shorthand to create a branch and checkout into it -->

<!-- ! git config --global init.defaultBranch main (this will make future master branches named main instead - if this works) -->
<!-- ! git branch -m <branch name>    (to change a branch name) -->
<!-- ! git branch -M <branch name>    (to change a branch name - but with the capital -M if this branch name already exists it may overwrite the branch!!!) -->

<!-- ! git branch -d <branch_name>    *deletes a branch if you're not on the one you're deleting -->

<!-- ? Pushing to GitHub -->
<!-- ! git remote add origin https://github.com/Jaxeus/git-2.0.git (used to manage remote repository - for backup purposes, usually) -->

<!-- ! git remote -v    (to check the version of our remote origin) -->

<!-- * git fetch (automatically called when we git pull) -->

<!-- ! git branch -m main (may need to do this before pushing to GitHub) -->

<!-- ! git push -u <remote> <branch>    (-u is --set-upstream, this sets and pushes to the remote branch you specify) -->
<!-- ! If you do    git push --set-upstream origin main   then it will push your local main to the main on GitHub. If you are on a different branch you may need to do it again for a new branch matching the same name -->

<!-- ? Other flags -->
<!-- * git branch -r  (lists all branches at origin - maybe ones you haven't created) -->
<!-- * git branch -a  (to see all local and remote branches) -->

<!-- ? Checking a commit's code on the CLI -->
<!-- ! git checkout <commit ID>    (this will switch you to a commit - viewing a commit, you're in a 'detached HEAD' state - like a read-only area unless you commit something. You're kind of in an out of body (tree) viewing. You can use this to check what your code was at the commit you specify the ID for!) -->
<!-- ! git switch -   (to exit your transcendental experience viewing a previous commit) -->
